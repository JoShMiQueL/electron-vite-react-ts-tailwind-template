# electron-vite-react-ts-tailwind-template

This project is a template for creating desktop applications with Electron, Vite, React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. It includes the necessary configurations to compile, run and package the application, as well as some example components to start developing.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Yarn or npm

## Installation

Clone this repository or use the "Use this template" button on GitHub to create your own project based on this template.

Install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
yarn # or npm install
```

## Usage

To start the application in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start # or npm run start
```

This will launch two processes: one for the Electron main process and another for the rendering process with Vite. The application will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.

To package the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
yarn make # or npm run make
```

This will create an installer for your platform in the out folder. You can customize the packaging options in the forge.config.js file.
